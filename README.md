# 42-get_next_line
This repository holds my implementation of 42 Silicon Valley's "get_next_line" project

The goal of this project/function (as implied by the name) is to create a C function
to get the next line of a file.

The bonus part of this function is to add the ability to handle multiple file descriptors,
which I have done.
